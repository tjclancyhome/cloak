# Development Notes

## 11/23/2014

I am restructuring the game an redoing the graphics so that it is more like
Dungeon Crawl and Steve Losh's caves game in clojure where the adventurer
stays centered in the viewport while the dugeon itself pans in the desired
direction.  Not quite sure how to do this but this is the plan.
